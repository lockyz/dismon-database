# Dismon Database
You can use this folder to help us update the Database for [Dismon](https://github.com/lockyz/Dismon)

Please try to go off the official [Pokemon Website's Pokedex](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/) or [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Pok%C3%A9mon_by_generation) when getting your information.

Once you've submitted an update to the file we will review it and if approved it will be added.

## What is here?
Here we have the Pokedex Database and soon other databases for every command for Dismon.

## Why are you allowing Community Contributions?
The database is hard to update with just a few people so we've opened it up to everyone.
